# Accuracy and Balanced Accuracy
Accuracy and balanced accuracy metrics for multi-task learning based on Pytorch

## Main feature
Use the multi-label confusion matrix to compute accuracy and balanced accuracy for multi-task learning

## Usage
It can be used in multi-task training and testing. For usage, you can refer to ```validate.py```

## Reference
The calculation formulas of metrics come from: Zheng, Xin , et al. "A Survey of Deep Facial Attribute Analysis." International Journal of Computer Vision 8(2020).
